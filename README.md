# express-bootstrap

An `Express` / `Mongo` starting app, that offers identification and flash messages, tested with `Jest` 

Because I did that a dozen times and I don't want to start all over everytime.

Feel free to grab it, improve it and make amazing stuff with. Please star the project if you did so, just for my ego ;)
